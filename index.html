  <h2>Plans</h2>
  <p>We hope to have parties more often and maybe have more years included,
    and also we will need better organisation like a way to sign in to the
    party and better equipment like chairs or tables.</p>

    <div id="location">
  <h2>Location</h2>
  <p>We do not know yet where it will be but if you have a idea we need it
    to be on a field with some shade and not where other people will be like a 
  park which will already have people so we cant use it. Also not needed but 
    if possible not surrounded by houses.
